# **SeqRefiner: A Scalable and Model-Free Pipeline for Sequence Embedding, Clustering, and Functional Annotation**

**SeqRefiner** is a robust, scalable, and **model-free bioinformatics pipeline** designed to **embed**, **cluster**, and **annotate biological sequences**. It leverages **transformer-based embeddings** (e.g., **ESM2**) to provide **unsupervised clustering** and **nearest-neighbor AMR classification** without requiring supervised models. Additionally, SeqRefiner offers powerful tools for **novelty detection** and **traceability**, making it ideal for large-scale **antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene annotation** and functional genomics research.

## Key Features:

* **Model-Free AMR Prediction**: Uses **ESM2 embeddings** for sequence-to-sequence comparisons and nearest-neighbor classification without the need for a supervised model.
* **Unsupervised Clustering**: Leverages **UMAP** and **HDBSCAN** to group sequences by functional similarities without the need for pre-labeled data.
* **Novelty Detection**: Identifies potentially novel sequences that do not match known AMR genes.
* **Confidence Scoring**: Provides **confidence scores** for each annotation, categorizing them as High, Medium, or Low confidence based on similarity to nearest neighbors.
* **Traceability**: Links each sequence prediction to its **top K nearest AMR gene references**, providing full transparency for results.
* **Extensible**: Designed to be adaptable for applications beyond AMR, such as **virulence factors**, **enzyme functions**, and **novel sequence discovery**.

## Usage

### 1. **Prepare Input Data**

* **Unlabeled Dataset**: Protein sequences in **FASTA format**.
* **Reference Datasets**: Known AMR genes from **CARD** and **ResFinder** databases.

### 2. **Run the Pipeline**:

* **Step 1**: Sequence embedding using ESM2

  ```bash
  python get_embeddings_large.py
  ```

* **Step 2**: Dimensionality reduction and clustering

  ```bash
  python cluster_and_annotate.py
  ```

* **Step 3**: AMR annotation via nearest-neighbor classification

  ```bash
  python predict_amr_ensemble_confidence.py
  ```

* **Step 4**: Traceability and novelty detection

  ```bash
  python trace_amr_sources.py
  python score_novelty.py
  ```

* **Step 5**: Cluster-wise AMR summary

  ```bash
  python cluster_amr_summary.py
  ```

* **Step 6**: Generate visualizations

  ```bash
  python plot_umap_by_amr.py
  python plot_confidence_histogram.py
  python plot_confidence_vs_similarity.py
  ```

## Features

1. **Transformer-Based Sequence Embedding**: Using **ESM2 embeddings** to capture deep relationships in protein sequences.
2. **Unsupervised Clustering**: Group similar sequences using **UMAP** and **HDBSCAN**.
3. **Nearest-Neighbor AMR Classification**: Classify sequences using **cosine similarity** with **reference AMR genes**.
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Calculate the reliability of each prediction based on top K nearest neighbors.
5. **Novelty Detection**: Flag sequences that are distant from known AMR genes, signaling potentially new or divergent sequences.
6. **Cluster-wise Functional Summaries**: Identify dominant AMR classes in each cluster and generate interpretable summaries.
7. **Visualization Tools**: Includes UMAP plots, confidence histograms, and novelty highlight plots to aid in result interpretation.
